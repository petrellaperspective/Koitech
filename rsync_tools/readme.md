# Rsync Migration Tool

### Summary
This is a simple script that runs the built-in rsync tool to the migrate files from one directory to another directory.

**Note: If you're migrating a user's directory You must run this as _sudo_ due to the permissions required as administrator to transfer everything successfully**

### Example of migrating
It is recommended to put in the full path for the Source and Target when prompted.

**Source**
`/Volumes/Backup_Drive/allmystuff`

**Target**
`/Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Users/billycabbage/newlocation`

Still in the process of streamlining and automating more options as time allows.
