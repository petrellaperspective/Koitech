### Adobe Troubleshooting
Prior to uninstalling if an application is having problems try these steps to resolve it

#### REMOVE OOBE Files
There are two OOBE (Out Of Box Experience) file directories on the macOS computer that stores
the preferences for the Adobe applications including Creative Cloud Desktop. Navigate to
`/Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Library/Application\ Support/Adobe` for the computer's OOBE directory.

Navigate to `/Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Users/billycabbage/Library/Application\ Support/Adobe` for
user's OOBE library. It's recommended to delete this directory first as it often is tied to the
user's account that the adobe application is failing to start or work correctly

#### Run Adobe Creative Cloud Cleaner
Download the creative cloud cleaner tool and run it to remove the specific application or to remove
almost everything. This page includes also the tool for windows as well.

This will remove MOST of the directories and files but there could still be older files and installers
left behind.
