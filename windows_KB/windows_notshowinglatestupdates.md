# Windows not showing latest available Updates

Windows updates are infamous though they are important for security patches and do offer the occasional improved feature. But what if for some reason no matter how many times you check for updates you're stuck on 1909 or 2004?

### The latest version of Windows 10 Feature update as of this writing on June 13, 2022 standard Earth Time is
### 21H2

When you go to the Windows Start Menu and go to **Settings** go to **System* and the **About** To find your current OS build info you'll see something like this with your edition of Windows and the current version

Now Windows 10 should update to the latest version but it can fail for a number of reasons but there is way to force it to update.

Go to https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10

Then download the latest Update installer by clicking the Update now button as seen below

Once downloaded run the installer.

It will Inform whether or not you are running the latest version as in this example it is running one version behind 21H1 instead of 21H2. Hit **Update Now** to start
