### Disabling App Readiness

App Readiness is a service that is set to manual by default but curiously I've noticed
it can potentially cause black screens when a user logs in or after sleep even though
the computer is functioning. It also can slow down the user login getting into the system.

Disabling haven't found any drawbacks and the speed increase was quite noticeable.
