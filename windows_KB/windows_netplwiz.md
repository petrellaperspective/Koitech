# Using Netplwiz

Netplwiz is a tricky utility to rememberbut often use it to quickly get the info I need on
the local and domain accounts on the machine.

Go to search and type **netplwiz** to find it the quickiest

From there it will list all the accounts that are enabled and list of local users you can click on
**Properties** to get more info like the full name, group membership and quickly toggle one to
administrator if needed.

On the **User Accounts** window you can access some additional settings in the **Advanced** tab

And if you click on the **Advanced** under **Advanced user management** you will get access to this
next screen which shows all the accounts and groups settings. You can then access those to make changes
enable or remove accounts. This is handy if you're not sure if an account got removed but is missing from
Users in the settings pane.
